# Gobeats

A Music Media Server that aims to provide a very quick way to navigate a large collection of music (~200K files). It does not read the MP3 tags, and simply relies on the file-based classification of the user's collection. The collection can also be searched. Audio files not supported by HTML5 can be transcoded on the fly.

## Installation

Currently in heavy development. Things may change, a lot.
